A spinoff the yahtzee game my parents taught me to play. Implemented completely in c# you (currently) have the options of playing offline and vs a basic AI i wrote.
In the future it is planned to add online play, also there is offline play versus another person codded in just not implemented.
Also I plan on fixing the visuals of the game since currently they are just mono colors, adding different skins for dice and optimizing the AI.
